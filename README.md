# Hi there, I'm John Uel Mangaba ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on exciting projects that challenge and inspire me.

ðŸŒ± I'm always learning and exploring new technologies and ideas.

ðŸ‘¯ I'm open to collaboration and eager to work with passionate individuals or teams.

âš¡ Fun fact: I tried learning web development because I wanted to become an expert in web bug bounty programs. I thought learning how to code first before exploiting things. xD
